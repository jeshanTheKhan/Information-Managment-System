Description:
This project implements a basic security system for managing student information. It includes the following features:

1. Administrator Login: The system begins with an administrator login, requiring a username and password. The default username is "admin," and the password is "password."

2. Menu-Driven Interface: After successful login, the administrator is presented with a menu-driven interface that offers the following options:
   - Add Information: Allows the administrator to input and store information about a student, including their name, parents' names, department, HSC subject, HSC grade, date of birth, and nationality. The data is appended to a text file named "student_info.txt."
   - Show Information: Displays the stored student information from the "student_info.txt" file.
   - Clear Information: Clears all stored student information from the file.
   - Exit: Exits the program.

3. Data Storage: Student information is stored in a plain text file named "student_info.txt," making it easy to access and modify.

4. Error Handling: The program includes error handling to deal with issues like file access errors.

This project can serve as a starting point for a more comprehensive student information management system, and it provides a simple example of how to create a menu-driven console application in C++. Users can customize and expand upon this project to suit their specific needs for managing student records securely.
